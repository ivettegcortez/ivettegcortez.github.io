			<p class = "intro">Hello! So you want to know more about me? Well, I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. I graduated from LaGuardia High School as an arts major. I achieved my bachelors degree from NYU in Sociology and minored in Web programming and Applications. I consider myself creative as I love to create content for web designs such as my own website. I've also incorporated a fun part time job as a photographer. I love meeting new people and learning more about their upbringings and aspirations so that I can grow. A strong belief of mine is that a person never stops growing, it's just their devotion to it. I love traveling and sharing pictures to those that don't have the opportunity to visit such places. This way I am able to show others the various dream locations earth has to offer through my lens. I am very interested in the arts and sharing knowledge so I would say my dream is to incorporate both where I can help people have a better way to navigate to their necessary resources for a better living. Life is too short to not try and reach for your dreams don’t you think?</p>
