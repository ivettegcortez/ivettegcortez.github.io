			<p class = "intro">Hello! So you want to know more about me? Well, I grew up in Brooklyn, NY. I graduated from LaGuardia high school as an arts major and got my bachelors from NYU, majoring in Sociology and minoring in Web programming and Applications. I am very creative and thus created my own website to showcase my love for web design and incorporated a fun part time job I have as a photographer. I love to meet new people and learn more about their upbringings to seek aspiration for better growth because I believe everyone can always keep up their personal growth. I love traveling and sharing pictures to those that do not have the opportunity to visit such places. This way I am able to show others the various dreams locations that earth has to offer through my lens. Ideally, I am very interested in the arts and knowledge so I would say my dream is to incorporate both where I can help people have a better way to navigate to their necessary resources for a better living. Life is too short to not try and reach for your dreams donâ€™t you think? </p>
