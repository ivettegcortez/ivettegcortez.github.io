			<h2 id ="topdesc">Welcome to my photography page!
			I make myself known as a photographer along with web design because I love taking pictures, and I believe that capturing the right shot can share immense beauty that other people donâ€™t normally see within people or places. I specialize in portraits and occasionally do landscapes. If you are interested in getting some pictures for a private session or just want to connect for the love of photos feel free to contact me!</h2>
