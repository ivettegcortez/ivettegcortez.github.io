						<p>Full House started originally in 1987 and ran all the way to 1995. It managed to get up to 8 seasons until the producers had no other choice but to cancel it. They later, however, came out with Fuller House to have the hardcore fans eager to continue watching.</p>
					</article>

					<article>
						<p>The main reason behind the canceling of the series was because it was announced that the prices to continue it was going to be too much and inaffordable. The actors on the show seem to all enjoy their television days as they were deemed to be the old, funny, and admirable family.</p>
					</article>

					<article>
						<p>Even though this show was aired so long ago, it continued to air reruns on nickelodeon and other TV channels. The DVDs were even still being produced because it was just that popular. Even at 2019, it still shows some success.</p>
